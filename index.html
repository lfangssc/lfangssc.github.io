      <h2>Retail Price Setting, Optimization and Elasticity</h2>
      <p class="description">Retail price setting refers to the process of determining the optimal price at which a product or service should be sold to customers. It involves analyzing various factors such as production costs, market demand, competition, and customer behavior to arrive at an effective pricing strategy. The goal of retail price setting is to maximize revenue and profitability while ensuring customer satisfaction and market competitiveness.</p>
      <p class="description">We are able to accurately extract the elasticities of the SKUs using demand modeling and machine learning. We optimize the SKU prices using latest Optimization algorithm. </p>
      <p class="description"> Price optimization can lead to 3 to 5 perentage revenue increase. </p>

      <h2>Supply Chain Forecasting using Tensorflow Probability</h2>
      <p class="description">Supply chain is a core business segment. Forecasting and risk assessment is critical for business decision in supply chain </p>
      <p class="description">We apply tensorflow probability and other forecasting technologies such as LSTM deep learning to make solid and reasonable forecasting. </p>

      <h2>Visual AB Testing using Probabilistic Programming</h2>
      <p class="description">AB testing is the most common used technique in marketing. The traditional stastics method is hard to interperate for business stakeholder who don't have stastics background. The p value and when to reject the null hypothesis is not straightforward to understand.</p>
      <p class="description">We use the probabilistic programming to simulate the conversion rates and visualize the sample distributions of controlled and treatment groups. The probabilistic approach makes the AB testing is remarkably easy understand. </p>

      <h2>Yolo: Don't Let Customer Waiting</h2>
      <p class="description">We apply YOLO algorithm for object detection and tracking.</p>
      <p class="description">We can accurately to determine the customer's location and send alarm to customer services if the customers' wating longer than 10 minutes.</p>
      <p class="description">We are capable to do real time image collection, analysis and optimizaiton without high GPU cost.</p>
