      <h2>Django Machine learning Apps, MLOps and Deployment </h2>
      <p class="description">I build interactive machine learning apps using the latest python web framework, Docker container, MLOps, GIT and cloud managed services </p>
      <p class="description">Here demo my owned an AB testing APP. The algorithm I used is called probabilistic programming which can visually display the probability significance of treatment sample against the controlled sample. This method is considered to deliver more reliable AB testing compared to the traditional null hypothesis.   </p>
      <br>
      <p class="description"> The app is built by Django and plotly.js. Docker, CI/CD tool of GITHUB Action and AWS managed APP engine Beanstalk with autoscaling are used for app deployment. </p>

      <h2>Retail Price Setting, Optimization and Elasticity</h2>
      <p class="description">Retail price setting refers to the process of determining the optimal price at which a product or service should be sold to customers. It involves analyzing various factors such as production costs, market demand, competition, and customer behavior to arrive at an effective pricing strategy. The goal of retail price setting is to maximize revenue and profitability while ensuring customer satisfaction and market competitiveness. Price optimization can lead to 3 to 5 percentage revenue increase.</p>
      <p class="description">I are able to accurately extract the elasticities of the SKUs using demand modeling and machine learning. I also optimize the SKU prices using the latest Optimization algorithm. </p>
      <p class="description">I have successfully implemented pricing solutions in leading groceries, retails, and fast food chains. </p>
