      <h2>Django Machine learning Marketing App, MLOps and Deployment </h2>
      <p class="description">I build interactive machine learning APPs using python web framework Django, Docker, version control and cloud managed services </p>
      <p class="description">Here demo my owned AB testing APP. The algorithm I used is called probabilistic programming which compares the probability significance of the treatment sample against the controlled sample. This method is considered to deliver more reliable AB testing compared to the traditional null hypothesis.   </p>
      <br>
      <p class="description"> The tech stack of the app is Django, plotly.js, Docker, CI/CD tool of GITHUB Action and AWS managed APP engine Beanstalk with autoscaling. </p>

      <h2>Supply Chain Route Optimization</h2>
      <p class="description">One of the most common supply chain optimization tasks is vehicle routing, in which the goal is to find the best routes for a fleet of vehicles visiting a set of locations.</p>
      <p class="description">There are different approaches to address the routing optimization challenges, here I demo a simple case using the dynamic programming to help a salesman to plan travel on 13 cities.  </p>
      <p class="description">The demo here is an interactive visualization using folium package based on the solution of dynamic programming. </p>

      <h2>Risk Forecasting using Tensorflow Probability Monte Carlo  </h2>
      <p class="description">Risk forecasting is important for business operation of many industries such as supply chain, transportation, finance and clinical operations, et, al.</p>
      <p class="description">Risk forecasting is usually hard to solve as lacking information and future is unpredictable for most cases.   </p>
      <p class="description">I implement the latest Tensorflow Probability Algorithms to conduct advanced Monte Carlo simulations based on probability programming. The algorithm is able to simulate random walks based on limited historical data that have no clear patterns.  </p>

      <h2>Retail Price Setting, Optimization and Elasticity</h2>
      <p class="description">Retail price setting refers to the process of determining the optimal price at which a product or service should be sold to customers. It involves analyzing various factors such as production costs, market demand, competition, and customer behavior to arrive at an effective pricing strategy. The goal of retail price setting is to maximize revenue and profitability while ensuring customer satisfaction and market competitiveness. Price optimization can lead to 3 to 5 percentage revenue increase.</p>
      <p class="description">I extract the elasticities of SKUs using demand modeling and machine learning. I also optimize the SKU prices using the latest Constraint Optimization algorithm such as Google OR tools. </p>
      <p class="description">I have successfully implemented pricing solutions in leading groceries, retails, and fast food chains. </p>

      <p class="description">YOLO, referring to 'You only look one times', is the computer vision algorithm for object detection and tracking.</p>
      <p class="description">The algorithm accurately determines customer's locations and sends alarms to customer services if the customers' waiting longer than 10 minutes.</p>
      <p class="description">I customize the YOLO to conduct video analysis and process optimization for GPU cost control.</p>
